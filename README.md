# Eye Movement Project

## Description

The Eye Movement Project is an interactive web application that simulates an eye following the cursor's movement across the screen. It features a simple yet engaging design with a white eye on a blue background. The pupil, represented by a black circle, moves within the white eye in response to mouse movements, creating a dynamic and visually appealing effect. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and responsive web components.
